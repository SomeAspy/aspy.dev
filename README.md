# Aspy.dev

My Personal website that I work on in my free time.

It may not look the best but I'm proud of it. I'm not good with HTML or CSS, but its been a lot of fun and a great learning experience working on this. When I started this project I had no idea how CSS worked.

This site also incorporates some stuff for its subdomains, like the stuff under /external

I develop this website with Chrome Canary in mind, and also test for Firefox Nightly with lower priority. This is simply due to the market share for the browsers. Testing with Edge will generally not be done.
That being said, if you find any issues please open an issue!

## Hosting

I host the base domain on Cloudflare Pages. Subdomains on the site are generally hosted using Vercel, or more rarely, GitHub Pages.

## Goals

Some goals are listed in the TODO.txt file.
However, the main goals I have for this site are as follows:

### Modern Standards

One of my goals for the site is to continually use the latest features, for example, WebP, and AVIF or JPEG XL when support is finalized. This website entirely does not support Internet Explorer, for these reasons.

### Technical Perfectionism

I aim for a 100 in all categories of Google's Lighthouse auditing system, as well as having no errors or warnings in the console.

### Unique

I do not use templates or color pallettes. All SCSS and JSX is made by me, by hand.
